        <h2><i>"India, The land of vedas, the remarkable works contain not only religious ideas for a perfect life but
                also facts which science has proven true, the land of belief, prosperity, love, care and determination
                to grow together."</i></h2>
        <br>






        <h3><b>" This is indeed India!" The land of dreams and romance, of fabulous wealth and poverty, of splendour and
                rags, of palaces and hovels of famine and pestilence, of genii and giants, of tigers and elephants, the
                cobra and the jungle, the country of hundred nations and hundred tongues, of a thousand religions and
                two million gods, the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of hundered speech, mother of history,
                traditions whose yesterday's bear date with the modering antiquities for the rest of nations. The one
                sole country under the sun that is endowed with an imperishable interest for the peasant, for lettered
                and ignorant, wise and fool, rich and poor, bond and free, the one land that everyone desire to see, and
                having seen once, but even a glimpse, would not give that glimpse for the shows of all the rest of the
                world.
                <br>
                The rich heritage of India, one of the world's oldest civilizations, is an all-embracing confluence of
                religions, traditions and customs. The highlights of Indian heritage lie in the treasure of its art,
                architecture, classical dance, music, flora and fauna, and the innate secular philosophy of its people.
                A visit to the heritage sites is like a walk through history, changing lanes with every dynasty that
                ruled Indian soils. The finesse of Indian handiwork, the richness of silk and cotton textiles, the
                ethnicity of jewellery, everything has come down as a heritage from ancient times and is being kept
                alive generation after generation. Even food in India is a legacy and part of Indian heritage, differing
                in look and taste in every state of India.
